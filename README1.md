# 🌱 BrainBonsai

**BrainBonsai** is a gamified Web3 learning and onboarding platform that helps people understand blockchain ecosystems through exploration, not static courses.

Learning is visualized as a growing digital garden.  
When a learning tree reaches maturity, users receive an **on-chain NFT credential** representing their learning journey.

BrainBonsai is designed for **confidence-building**, not speculation.

## 🧠 The Problem

Web3 onboarding is broken because:
- Wallets, gas, and transactions feel irreversible and risky
- Learning resources become outdated quickly
- Proof of learning is informal and non-verifiable
- New users are forced into technical complexity too early

---

## 🌳 The BrainBonsai Solution

BrainBonsai introduces **progressive, low-fear onboarding** using three layers:

1. **Simulation (Sandbox)** — zero-risk interaction with Web3 concepts  
2. **Exploration (Learning Garden)** — guided conceptual understanding  
3. **Verification (On-chain Credential)** — proof of learning on-chain  

Users are never forced into real blockchain interactions before they are ready.

## 🌱 Learning Model

Each topic is represented as a **seed**:
- Ethereum
- Layer 2s
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- DeFi primitives
- Protocol ecosystems

### Learning actions grow the tree:
- Exploring concepts → branches
- Flashcards → leaves
- Quizzes → fruits & flowers

Tree maturity increases with engagement, not time.

## 🏅 On-Chain Learning Credentials

When a tree reaches maturity, BrainBonsai mints a **learning credential NFT**.

### NFT Standard
- **ERC-721**
- One NFT per completed learning seed
- Non-financial, non-transfer-focused usage

### NFT Represents
- Topic explored
- Completion status
- Issuer (BrainBonsai)
- Timestamp and metadata
- Wallet ownership

> These NFTs are **proof of participation and understanding**, not academic certificates.

---

## ⛽ Gasless & Beginner-Friendly Minting

BrainBonsai removes friction by sponsoring transactions:

- Users do **not** need ETH
- Gas fees are paid by the platform
- NFTs are minted directly to user wallets

This enables **first-time Web3 participation without financial risk**.

---

## 🧾 Account Abstraction & Wallets

BrainBonsai uses a **progressive custody model**:

### Current Architecture
- Wallets are created automatically on sign-in
- Private keys are encrypted at rest
- Users interact without handling keys directly

### Forward-Compatible Design
BrainBonsai is designed to support:
- **ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)**
- Gas sponsorship via paymasters
- Session keys for limited permissions
- Optional migration to full self-custody

> Custodial by default. User-owned by choice.

## 🧸 Web3 Sandbox (Simulation Layer)

BrainBonsai includes an interactive **Web3 Sandbox** that simulates:

- Wallet addresses
- Token transfers
- Transaction confirmations
- Gas fees
- Block explorers
- NFTs and ownership

### Sandbox Principles
- No real blockchain
- No real keys
- No real money
- Fully reversible actions

The sandbox builds mental models **before** real on-
